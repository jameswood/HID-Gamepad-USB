# HID-Gamepad-USB

## Warning: does not upload from Platformio. I can't figure it out.

USB gamepad/joystick interface for the small ATMEGA16U2 microcontroller on an Arduino Uno. Requires the [Hoodloader2 bootloader](https://github.com/NicoHood/HoodLoader2) to be installed.

Receives joystick position/button info from the ATMEGA328P (the large microcontroller) via a high-speed serial link.
